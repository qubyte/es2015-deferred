# History

## 4.0.0

This module is shipped in ES module format only now. It also assumes an ES2015
or later version of JavaScript. If you need a UMD module or support for an ES5
environment, use version 3.

## 3.0.0

Adds module field to package.json for ES2015 module loaders. This is a major
version bump since it might affect how existing bundles are built.

## 2.0.1

Documentation update.

## 2.0.0

The `resolve` and `reject` methods now return the promise, for simpler chaining.
These were previously returning `undefined`.
